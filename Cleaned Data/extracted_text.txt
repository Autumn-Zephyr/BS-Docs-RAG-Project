OPPE1 will not be scheduled for students who fail to complete the
OPPE SCT exam.
Eligibility to appear for the OPPE 2:
Most courses have eligibility criteria to attend the final exam.
In case you do not become eligible to write the final exam, OPPE2
will also not be scheduled for you as you will be awarded
WA/WQ grade and anyway have to repeat the entire course the next
time including all assessment components.
In addition, Python, PDSA and Java have criteria based on GrPA
scores of weeks 1-8 to be eligible to appear for the OPPEs. Please
check the grading formula for these courses for more details.
*TDS has a Remote Online Exam (ROE), which is a non-proctored,
open internet exam. No SCT is required for TDS.
We might have additional dates for OPPEs depending on the number of
students who register for courses with OPPEs. These dates could be any
date and timing of OPPE week.
Once we know the actual registration numbers for every course, we
will finalise the dates and timings.

Week 7 - eligibility for final exams for most courses depends on the average assignment
scores of best 5 out of the first 7 weeks. The dates are highlighted in green here.
Week 10 - GAA score for final grade will be taken and calculated for applicable courses
MAJOR CHANGE THIS TIME:
Weightage for GAA in Foundation Level courses is being made 0. Questions for a total
of 10 marks in the 2 quizzes and End term exam will come from the assignments.
Weightage for GAA in Diploma Level courses will be 5 marks. Questions for a total of
5 marks in the 2 quizzes and End term exam will come from the assignments.
Weightage for GAA in Degree Level courses remains unchanged.

● The course team may set up additional activities in the course
which will be eligible for upto 3 bonus marks. If no additional
activities are set up, this bonus won't be applicable.
Participation in the discourse forum: Badges
We will be looking at active engagement with Discourse in a term and
provide badges for participation.
Badges will be given based on the number of hours a student spends on
Discourse. A student is expected to spend a minimum of 1 hour per week
per course in Discourse reading posts.
Student will get the following badges:
Read time of upto 4 hours per course in a term: Badge 1
Read time of upto 8 hours per course in a term: Badge 2
Read time of upto 12 hours per course or more: Badge 3
(Applicable only after you get the BS student roll number)
Information about course grades:
S,A,B,C,D,E - Pass grade; U/WA/WQ - Fail grade I - Incomplete
In I grade - there are 3 types:
a. If you are absent for ET alone but all other assessment
components are completed (quizzes, OPPEs, project, weekly
assignments) - grade will be pushed as I.
Options: You can register to take up the ET exam alone in the
subsequent term. OPPE and quizzes will not be scheduled for
you. All other marks for Final course score will be taken from the
previous run. The fee will be charged only for the end term exam.
OR
You can choose to repeat the entire course paying the full course
fees.
b. If you have failed in the OPPE but wrote the ET exam and crossed
the cutoff for T as given in the course grading policy, grade =
I_OP.
You can register to do the OPPE alone whereby if the course has
one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs,
both will be scheduled for you. You can attempt the OPPE alone.
All other mark components of FInal course score will be taken
from the previous run. ET and quizzes will not be scheduled for
you.
c. If you have failed in the OPPE and absent for ET, then grade =
I_BOTH
You can register for ET and OPPEs alone. If the course has one
OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will
be scheduled for you. You will attempt the ET and OPPEs. Quiz
and GAA and other components will be taken from the previous
run and not scheduled.
In all the above cases, you can also choose to Repeat the entire course
and not just do the ET/OPPE alone if you want to reattempt all
assessment components.

chance.
● If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other
engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the
second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your
exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this or are
absent, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have
to do it in the subsequent term.
The calculation of Final course Score is proposed as follows:
GAA2= Average score of week 2 and 3 SQL based assignments

So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
● If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other
engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the
second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your
exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail/absent in
this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to
do it in the subsequent term.
● If you are absent on 25th April, you DON'T get another chance on

Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM
projects):
Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the Jan 2026 terms
who will be entering Degree level in the May 2026 term. Without
completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree
level courses from May 2026 onwards.
For entering the Degree level in May 2026, you have to complete
ALL projects and vivas by April 2026. `
BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by
Feb/March/April/May 2026 so that viva can be over in
Feb/March/April/May 2026. Project grade for all the courses will be
pushed on/before May 15th.
Students are requested to complete the projects at least two terms
before their diploma completion term i.e DO NOT REGISTER OR
HAVE PROJECTS ALONE LEFT IN YOUR LAST TERM OF DIPLOMA.
Very important: Viva policies
Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep
2021/Jan 2022 terms:
If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diplomas,
you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this
Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were
completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of
Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the
Diploma level.
When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the
BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made
up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.
Degree Level courses
Level of the course:
The first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level
of the course.
Eg: CT is CS1001 is a 1 level course.
Deep Learning CS3004 is a 3 level course.
Industry 4.0 MS4001 is a 4 level course.
BSc level:
It is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs
and SPG in the BSc level. Credits = 20
All remaining 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL
(maximum upto 4 credits from Table 2) or if there is an option to credit
campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.
BS level:
It is implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree
level in Sep 2023.
2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in
each of the BP and BD categories. Please refer course category in
table1
Out of the remaining 12 credits, it is MANDATORY to earn 4 credits in the
HS/MG category. HS/MG can come from inhouse electives or from
NPTEL-Table 3.
Remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or
Apprenticeship electives.
Apprenticeship:
Apprenticeship is completely optional. Students can also complete the
BS level by just doing only course work.

We are also collaborating with the Microsoft and AWS certification
program team to offer their courses for our students at discounted rates.
Would be good to complete some cloud certifications from this too when
we offer it. There are no credits for this.
It is important you learn more on programming and data science outside
of what the curriculum offers and strengthen your resume.
