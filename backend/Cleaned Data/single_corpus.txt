entering degree level in the may 2026 term. without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from may 2026 onwards. for entering the degree level in may 2026, you have to complete all projects and vivas by april 2026. ` bdm project final submission has to be done and approved by feb/march/april/may 2026 so that viva can be over in feb/march/april/may 2026. project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/before may 15th. students are requested to complete the projects at least two terms before their diploma completion term i.e do not register or have projects alone left in your last term of diploma. very important: viva policies students who completed app dev1, app dev2, mlp and bdm in sep 2021/jan 2022 terms: if you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two diplomas, you will get the diploma certificates. but your credits will not be 27 for this diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. the projects done as part of the courses of sep 2021/jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. so there is no issue with the diploma level. when you come to the bsc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the bsc certificate. hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the iitm bs program. degree level courses level of the course: the first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level of the course. eg: ct is cs1001 is a 1 level course. deep learning cs3004 is a 3 level course. industry 4.0 ms4001 is a 4 level course. bsc level: it is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs and spg in the bsc level. credits = 20 all remaining 8 credits can be earned from iitm bs courses or nptel (maximum upto 4 credits from table 2) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (iitm or other institutes), that too can be done. bs level: it is implemented wef sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in sep 2023. 2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in each of the bp and bd categories. please refer course category in table1 out of the remaining 12 credits, it is mandatory to earn 4 credits in the hs/mg category. hs/mg can come from inhouse electives or from nptel-table 3. remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or apprenticeship electives. apprenticeship: apprenticeship is completely optional. students can also complete the bs level by just doing only course work. swayam nptel approved dep/free

also collaborating with the microsoft and aws certification program team to offer their courses for our students at discounted rates. would be good to complete some cloud certifications from this too
